# Converter

## This project is based on a tvOS app from a [Hacking with Swift tutorial](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/110/build-a-unit-converter-for-tvos). My aim is to make the code easier to test and then add unit tests.

### More
- This app can convert distance, duration, mass or temperature units. 
- It's written in Swift 5.9 for tvOS 17.5.
- UI framework is UIKit. 
- I have left the UI of the app as is. My focus here is on refactoring and unit tests.
- A SwiftUI version is planned for later.
